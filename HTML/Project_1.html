                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups (340g) milk, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons (71g) melted butter or 1/3 cup (67g) vegetable oil</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your iron while you make the waffle batter.</li>
                <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and butter or oil.</li>
                <li>Mix together the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until combined. The batter will be a bit lumpy; that's OK.</li>
                <li>Cook the waffles as directed in the instructions that came with your waffle iron. Serve waffles hot with your toppings of choice.</li>
                <li>Store any leftover waffles, well wrapped, in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
            </ol>
